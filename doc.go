// Package govnr provides the facilities for running supervised, persistent goroutines ("background services") that, upon unexpected panics, re-run the provided function.
// This is similar to other libraries such as https://github.com/thejerf/suture, with several differences:
//
// 1. govnr accepts a context.Context and listens to its .Done() channel
//
// 2. starting a persistent process requires nothing more than calling govnr.Forever()
//
// 3. no reliance on global state
